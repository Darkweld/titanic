<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, millions of people migrated from Europe to North America. With the massive quantities of people wanting to migrate, shippers began to accommodate this growing demand with large and extravagant passenger ships. Among the competing liners, two rose to prominence among the others. These were the White Star Line and Cunard, and they were fierce rivals in this field. In 1907, Cunard produced two passenger liners that broke speed records in crossing the Atlantic, the <i>Lusitania</i> and the <i>Mauretania</i>. White Star Line rose to this challenge by hiring the shipbuilder Harland and Wolff to construct three “Olympic-class” vessels, the <i>Olympic</i>, the <i>Titanic</i>, and the <i>Britannic</i>. These vessels were highly touted by the White Star line as being the largest and most luxurious vessels ever created, and were marketed toward crossing the Atlantic in with all the modern conveniences of the time. </p>
<p>	When people think about the Titanic, one of the topics that always comes up is the differences between first, second, and third class. As with many things, the Titanic accommodated those who were willing to pay more by offering grander luxuries to those who paid more. First class tickets ranged from $150 ($3,700 today) to 4350 ($100,000), with the larger amounts being the luxurious Parlour suites. Second class was around $60 ($1500), and third class ranged from $15 ($375) to $40 ($1000). To put this in perspective, the average laborer only made 10$ a week during this time.
