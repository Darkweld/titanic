  {text: "In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, millions of people migrated from Europe to North America. With the massive quantities of people wanting to migrate, shippers began to accommodate this growing demand with large and extravagant passenger ships. Among the competing liners, two rose to prominence among the others. These were the White Star Line and Cunard, and they were fierce rivals in this field. In 1907, Cunard produced two passenger liners that broke speed records in crossing the Atlantic, the Lusitania and the Mauretania. White Star Line rose to this challenge by hiring the shipbuilder Harland and Wolff to construct three \“Olympic-class\” vessels, the Olympic, the Titanic, and the Britannic. These vessels were highly touted by the White Star line as being the largest and most luxurious vessels ever created, and were marketed toward crossing the Atlantic in with all the modern conveniences of the time. The Titanic’s passenger capacity was 2,435, while the Lusitania and Mauretania had 2,198 and 2,165, respectively."},
